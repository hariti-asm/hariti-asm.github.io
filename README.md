Hello there! I am asmae hariti, a passionate üíª junior web developer üíª based in üìçmorocco. I recently graduated with an honored degree in Computer Science from Hassan 1st university of science and technics , and I'm currently enrolled in the African Leadership eXchange program, where I'm expanding my skills and knowledge in software engineering.

I have experience working on full-stack web applications, with a focus on using Next.js, Prisma ORM, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript for frontend development. In addition, I am proficient in back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and SQL, and I'm familiar with C programming.

Besides my passion for web development, I have a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, and software design. As a curious learner, I am always looking for new challenges and ways to improve my skills. I am dedicated to staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.

Thank you for considering my background. Let's connect and discuss how we can work together to build innovative and efficient software solutions.
